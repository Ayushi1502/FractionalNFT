# Fractionalized NFTs â€“ Split NFT Ownership into Multiple Shares

## Key Features

- Supports splitting NFTs into multiple fractional shares
- Each holder can transfer their share to others
- Allows full share owners to redeem the full NFT
- Efficient and gas-friendly ownership mapping

## Future Scope
