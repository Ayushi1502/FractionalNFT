# Fractionalized NFTs â€“ Split NFT Ownership into Multiple Shares

## Project Description

Fractionalized NFTs allow a single NFT to be split into multiple ownership units, giving multiple users the ability to co-own and trade parts of a single high-value NFT. This opens up NFT ownership to broader participation.

## Project Vision

## Key Features

- Supports splitting NFTs into multiple fractional shares
- Each holder can transfer their share to others
- Allows full share owners to redeem the full NFT
- Efficient and gas-friendly ownership mapping

## Future Scope

- Integration with ERC-20 for trading shares on secondary markets
- Governance features for co-owners to vote on asset decisions
- Multi-NFT fractionalization in a vault-style format
- Integration with DeFi protocols for lending collateralized by shares
